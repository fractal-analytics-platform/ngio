ngio is a Python library designed to simplify bioimage analysis workflows, offering an intuitive interface for working with OME-Zarr files.

## What is Ngio?

Ngio is built for the [OME-Zarr](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/) file format, a modern, cloud-optimized format for biological imaging data. OME-Zarr stores large, multi-dimensional microscopy images and metadata in an efficient and scalable way.

Ngio's mission is to streamline working with OME-Zarr files by providing a simple, object-based API for opening, exploring, and manipulating OME-Zarr images and high-content screening (HCS) plates. It also offers comprehensive support for labels, tables and regions of interest (ROIs), making it easy to extract and analyze specific regions in your data.

## Key Features

### 📊 Simple Object-Based API

- Easily open, explore, and manipulate OME-Zarr images and HCS plates
- Create and derive new images and labels with minimal boilerplate code

### 🔍 Rich Tables and Regions of Interest (ROI) Support

- Extract and analyze specific regions of interest
- Tight integration with [Tabular Data](https://BioVisionCenter.github.io/ngio/stable/table_specs/overview/)

### 🔄 Scalable Data Processing (Coming Soon)

- Powerful iterators for processing data at scale
- Efficient memory management for large datasets

## Installation

You can install ngio via pip:

```bash
pip install ngio
```

To get started check out the [Quickstart Guide](https://BioVisionCenter.github.io/ngio/stable/getting_started/0_quickstart/).

## Supported OME-Zarr versions

Currently, ngio only supports OME-Zarr v0.4. Support for version 0.5 and higher is planned for future releases.

## Development Status

!!! warning
    Ngio is under active development and is not yet stable. The API is subject to change, and bugs and breaking changes are expected.
    We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Which means for 0.x releases potentially breaking changes can be introduced in minor releases.

### Available Features

- ✅ OME-Zarr metadata handling and validation
- ✅ Image and label access across pyramid levels
- ✅ ROI and table support
- ✅ Streaming from remote sources
- ✅ Documentation and examples

### Upcoming Features

- Advanced image processing iterators
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Support for OME-Zarr v0.5 and Zarr v3
