# Welcome to NGIO

NGIO is a Python library to streamline OME-Zarr image analysis workflows.

**Highlights:**

- Abstract object base API for handling OME-Zarr files
- Validate OME-Zarr files
- Powefull iterators for reading and writing data using common access patterns

## 🚧 Ngio is Under active Development 🚧
